# Foodsoft 3.2.0
(16 December 2013)

It's been a year since the previous release. Much has changed. Big changes have been:
* Translations to English, Dutch and French.
* Improved usability of delivery creation.
* The possibility to extend foodsoft with plugins (the wiki is now optional).
* Article search in the ordering screen.
* Foodcoops can choose to use full names and emails instead of nicknames.

* Upgrade to Rails 3.

When you upgrade, be sure to review `config/app_config.yml.SAMPLE`. When you're running multiple foodcoops from a single installation, check your rake invocations as the syntax is now: `rake multicoops:run TASK=db:migrate`.
